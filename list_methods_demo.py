# First, we will need a list of animals, to play with it
dummy_emojis = ['游냝','游냥','游냥','游붉']

# Let's add an item to the existing list
dummy_emojis.append('游냣')
print(dummy_emojis)

# Copy the list to another one
new_dummy = dummy_emojis.copy()
print(new_dummy)

# Where the heck is the monkey? let's find out
print(f"游냣 was found at {dummy_emojis.index('游냣')} position")

# How many pigs do we have in this list? let's count them
print('游냥 = ',dummy_emojis.count('游냥'))

# Add a doggie on this list, at index 3
dummy_emojis.insert(3,'游냤')
print(f"游냤 was inserted on {dummy_emojis}")

# Let's take the first pig out, with pop!
dummy_emojis.pop(1)
print(f"游냥 was removed from {dummy_emojis}")

# let's remove the cow on this list, ok?
dummy_emojis.remove('游냝')
print(f"游냝 was removed from {dummy_emojis}")

# Let's apply a reverse order on this list, shall we?
dummy_emojis.reverse()
print('Reversed List: ', dummy_emojis)
