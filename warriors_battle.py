# Real world objects have attributes and capabilities
 
# A dog for example has the attributes of height, weight
# favorite food, etc.
 
# It has the capability to run, bark, scratch, etc.
 
# In object oriented programming we model real world objects
# be defining the attributes (fields) and capabilities (methods)
# that they have.
 
# A class is the template used to model these objects
# Here we will model a Dog object

    # We give default values for the fields if none
    # are provided

        # them to the new Dog objects fields (attributes)
