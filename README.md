# EINSTIEG PYTHON PROGRAMMIERUNG

##### Getting started with Python programming:

This repo contains most of the excercises and small routines I have coded with Python 3 as a part of a learning process. I decided to keep updating this repo as my learning path keeps on growing and once I start using some other python tools I will ad another repo with graphical interface not console.

### Prerequisites

Most of these files, almost 97% will run without any issues under Python 3, with the exception of one or two files that were meant to be for Kivi but I don't remember at this moment which ones are those. Sorry about that, folks!

## Built With

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) - The language version used for these files.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - My Favorite Source Code Editor.
- [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) - A secondary source code Editor.
